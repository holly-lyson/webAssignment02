## Holly Zurenda - Assignment 04

> **MEAN**
> ---
> *MongoDB* (NoSQL DB), *Express.js* (backend web framework), *Angular* (front-end framework), *Node* (open-source cross-platform server)
> - Easy to use and open-sourced for data transmission and only done in JavaScript with JSON components.

> **Ruby on Rails (RoR)**

> - Object-oriented and open sourced web stack (compatible with HTML, CSS and JS)that uses the dynamic programming language Ruby and has XML or JSON for data transfers.

> **MERN**
> ---
> *MongoDB* (NoSQL DB), *Express.js* (backend web framework), *React* (front-end framework), *Node* (open-source cross-platform server)
> - Much like MEAN, however React gives the capabilities to build single-page apps and code-use can be done on both servers and browsers at the same time.

> **Flutter**
> ---
> - A cross-platform, open-sourced tech stack that is made up of Dart, Flutter, Foundation Library and Design-specific Widgets that can be used for IOS, Android, Windows, Mac and Linux apps.
